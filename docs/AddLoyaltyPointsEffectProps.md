# AddLoyaltyPointsEffectProps

This effect indicates that a defined amount of loyalty points was successfully added to the customer's profile or to a loyalty card.  If you use the [Add loyalty points per item effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/available-effects#reward-effects), use the `cartItemPosition` property to identify which item to add the loyalty points for.  Enabling [partial rewards](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/applications/manage-general-settings#partial-rewards) allows a rule that would fail because of insufficient budget to pass. The rule still fails when the budget reaches 0. Use the `desiredValue` property to identify the original amount of loyalty points.  If you use **Add loyalty points per item** and if the session contains some cart items with _quantity > 1_, use the `cartItemSubPosition` property to identify the item unit in its line item. See the example below for more information.  If your list of cart items is a [bundle definition](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/create-and-manage-bundles), use the `bundleIndex` and `bundleName` properties to identify the bundle containing the items for which loyalty points are added.  If you have set custom activation and expiration dates for the loyalty points, use the `startDate` and `expiryDate` properties to identify when the reward will be active and when will expire.  If the loyalty program is [profile-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types), use the `recipientIntegrationId` property to identify the user who receives the loyalty points. If the loyalty program is [card-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types), use the `cardIdentifier` property to identify the loyalty card on which these points are added.  The points only persist when the session is closed.
