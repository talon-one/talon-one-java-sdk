# DeductLoyaltyPointsEffectProps

This effect is triggered when a customer redeems loyalty points. The points are deducted from their active point balance.  If the loyalty program is card-based, use the `cardIdentifier` property to identify the loyalty card from which these points are deducted.  The Rule Engine deducts points in this order:  - Points with the earliest expiry date are deducted first, regardless of when they were added. - Points with an unlimited expiry date are deducted last. - For points with an unlimited expiry date, the points awarded first are deducted first.  The points only persist when the session is closed.
