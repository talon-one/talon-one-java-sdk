# CustomEffectProps

If you want to return data as an effect but no effect matches your use case, you can [create a custom effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/tutorials/create-custom-effects).  Custom effects can be used as both rule effects and failure effects.  The structure of a custom effect depends on your specifications but is always named `customEffect`.
