# RollbackIncreasedAchievementProgressEffectProps

This effect indicates that the customer's progress in an achievement was rolled back.  The Rule Engine triggers this effect when you cancel or [reopen a customer session](https://docs.talon.one/integration-api#tag/Customer-sessions/operation/reopenCustomerSession) that previously validated the [Update customer progress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#update-customer-progress) effect and triggered the [increaseAchievementProgress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects#increaseachievementprogress) API effect.  The effect is also triggered for completed achievements if the **Allow progress rollback for completed achievements** setting is enabled. You can enable this through the [Campaign Manager](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/achievements/manage-achievements) or the [Management API](https://docs.talon.one/management-api#tag/Achievements/operation/createAchievement) by setting the `achievementAllowRollbackAfterCompletion` property to `true`. This setting only applies to one-time and recurring on expiration achievements.
