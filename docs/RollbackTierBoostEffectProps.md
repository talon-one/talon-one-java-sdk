# RollbackTierBoostEffectProps

This effect indicates that a loyalty tier boost was rolled back.  The Rule Engine triggers this effect when you cancel a customer session that previously triggered the [boostLoyaltyTier](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects#boostloyaltytier) API effect. The tier boost is voided and the customer returns to the tier determined by their points balance.  This effect only applies to full session cancellations. Partially returned sessions do not trigger a tier boost rollback.
