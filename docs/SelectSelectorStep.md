# SelectSelectorStep

Picks a subset of the items by count, range, or exact position. The `operator` determines which additional fields are required: - `many` selects items from `from` (`start` or `end`) and is limited by `count`. - `between` selects items between integer indices `from` and `to`. - `one` selects the single item at `index`.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**type** | [**TypeEnum**](#TypeEnum) | A step discriminator of type &#x60;select&#x60;. |  |
|**operator** | [**OperatorEnum**](#OperatorEnum) | The selection operator applied to the items. |  |
|**from** | [**SelectSelectorStepFrom**](SelectSelectorStepFrom.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**to** | **Integer** | The end index for the &#x60;between&#x60; operator. The item at this index is not included. |  [optional] |
|**count** | **Integer** | The maximum number of items to select for the &#x60;many&#x60; operator. |  [optional] |
|**index** | **Integer** | The exact position of the item to select for the &#x60;one&#x60; operator. |  [optional] |
|**partial** | **Boolean** | Indicates if the step returns fewer items than requested when the source list is shorter than the range needs. Always &#x60;true&#x60; for the &#x60;many&#x60; and &#x60;between&#x60; operators; not present for &#x60;one&#x60;, which fails instead of returning a partial result. |  [optional] |
