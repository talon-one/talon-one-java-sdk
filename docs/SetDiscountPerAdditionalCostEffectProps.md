# SetDiscountPerAdditionalCostEffectProps

This effect indicates that a discount that should be applied on a specific additional cost. It is triggered whenever a rule containing a **Discount additional cost** effect is validated.  Enabling [partial rewards](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/applications/manage-general-settings#partial-rewards) allows a rule that would fail because of insufficient budget to pass. The rule still fails when the budget reaches 0. Use the `desiredValue` property to identify the original amount of loyalty points.
