# ChangeLoyaltyTierLevelEffectProps

This effect indicates that a customer's loyalty tier has been upgraded.  This effect is generated only when the [Add loyalty points](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#add-loyalty-points) and the [Add loyalty points per cart item](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#add-loyalty-points-per-cart-item) effects are triggered for a particular customer, and, as a result, the customer's loyalty tier is upgraded.
