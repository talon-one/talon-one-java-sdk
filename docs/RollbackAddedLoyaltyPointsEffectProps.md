# RollbackAddedLoyaltyPointsEffectProps

This effect is triggered in the following cases:  - A session was cancelled in which loyalty points have been added. - A session was partially returned and loyalty point were added by the returned items. See [returning items](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/tutorials/partially-return-a-session).  If you use the [Add loyalty points per item effect](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/available-effects#reward-effects), use the `cartItemPosition` property to identify which items the loyalty points were rolled back for.  If you use **Add loyalty points per item** and if the session contains some cart items with _quantity > 1_, use the `cartItemSubPosition` property to identify the item unit in its line item.  If the loyalty program is [profile-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types), use the `recipientIntegrationId` property to identify the user for whom the loyalty points are rolled back. If the loyalty program is [card-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types), use the `cardIdentifier` property to identify the loyalty card where the points were originally added.
