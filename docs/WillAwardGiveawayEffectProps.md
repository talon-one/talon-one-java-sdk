# WillAwardGiveawayEffectProps

The equivalent of the `awardGiveaway` effect but returned when updating a session with any state other than `closed`. This ensures no giveaway codes are leaked when they are still not guaranteed to be awarded.  For more information about session states, see [Manage the session's state](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions#manage-the-sessions-state).
