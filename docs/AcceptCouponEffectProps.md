# AcceptCouponEffectProps

This effect indicates that the coupon code supplied was valid.  You should handle this effect by clearing any messages from previous `rejectCoupon` effects and informing the user that the coupon is valid.  The code is automatically redeemed when you close the session.  Other effects, such as [setDiscount](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/integration-api/api-effects#setdiscount), provide more information about the actual rewards received.
