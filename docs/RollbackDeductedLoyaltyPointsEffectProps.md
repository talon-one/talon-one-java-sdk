# RollbackDeductedLoyaltyPointsEffectProps

This effect is triggered in the following cases:  - A session is _cancelled_ and this session deducted loyalty points. The rollback action returns the redeemed loyalty points to the customer. - A session is impacted by a _partial return_. Only added loyalty points that are still **pending** are rolled back. - A session in which loyalty points were spent is reopened.  See the [session states](https://docs.talon.one/docs/dev/concepts/entities/customer-sessions#customer-session-states).  If you set custom activation and expiration dates for the loyalty points, use the `startDate` and `expiryDate` properties to identify when the reward will be active and when will expire.  If the loyalty program is [profile-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/profile-based/profile-based-overview), use the `recipientIntegrationId` property to identify the user who receives the loyalty points. If the loyalty program is [card-based](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/loyalty-programs/overview#loyalty-program-types), use the `cardIdentifier` property to identify the loyalty card where the points are reimbursed.
