# IncreaseAchievementProgressEffectProps

This effect indicates that the customer's progress in an achievement was updated during the current session. It is triggered when a rule using the [Update customer progress](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/rules/effects/use-effects#update-customer-progress) effect is successfully validated.  For [on-completion achievements](https://docs.talon.one/docs/product/campaigns/achievements/achievements-overview#recurring-on-completion-achievements), any customer progress exceeding the target automatically starts a new iteration. This generates a new `progressTrackerId` for each iteration, and there can be multiple progress updates for the same achievement from a single validation of this effect.
